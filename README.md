Freckle for Mac
===============

Simple unintrusive mac app to create Freckle entries


Usage
=====

* Login with your domain (not the full url) and API Token (if unsure of how to obtain it, click the question mark in the login window).
* Click any project to start/stop it.
* Cmd + Click submits the logged time. Remember that the time field can interpret most of the formats the one in the Freckle website understans and that the comments field interprets comma separated values as tags.
* FreckleForMac mantains a list of the last 5 projects you used.
* You can remove a project from this list by using Cmd + Shift + Click.
* In an active project, that same combination only clears the time you are currently tracking, it does not remove the project from favorites.


Future work
===========

* User inactivity detection in case you go get lunch and forget to stop tracking.
* Configuration window.
